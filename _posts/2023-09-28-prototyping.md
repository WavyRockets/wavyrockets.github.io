A prototype is the first step towards developing an idea into a functioning product and can be used to demonstrate or test a new concept before it is released to the public. Another advantage is that they are inexpensive and quick to produce, saving time and money by solving problems sooner rather than later.

There are various levels of prototyping that range from low, mid and high-fidelity, which describe the level of simplicity that goes into making them. A low-fidelity prototype, for example, could be as simple as drawings on a piece of paper whereas high-fidelity prototypes can often be as detailed and interactive as the final product. The more simple prototypes are useful for quick turn around and tend to focus more on the user flow than the user interface whereas the more advanced prototypes help to give a more realistic feel of what will eventually be developed.

As a Product Designer, I often create prototypes throughout each phase of the product development by using various different methods to demonstrate user flows and interactions. They are an essential part of the development lifecycle and something no product should be without. <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/ano4JpbGQUmL9dQhwlHaUb/Onboarding-Improvements?type=design&node-id=246-4527&viewport=88%2C2985%2C0.29&t=y764G2ozSecs1uAk-0&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=246%3A4527" target="_blank">Test this prototype</a> to discover more.
