title: "About Scott McLintock"
---

I was born and raised on the outskirts of Glasgow, Scotland, where I achieved an honours degree in Multimedia Technologies. I began my career as a design intern working for Glasgow based digital agency Creative Oceanic. Throughout this six-month period I gained my first taste of what it would be like working in the technology sector while still finishing my degree. 

After graduating from the West of Scotland University, I began working as a Junior Designer for another Glasgow based digital agency, Mine Digital. During my time there I was responsible for all aspects of design ranging from branding, print, web and mobile app design. I soon advanced to the role of Digital Designer where I developed the necessary programming skills for implementing the user interfaces I was designing.

With a keen interest in expanding my understanding of developing responsive user interfaces, I pursued the role of Front-End Developer with The Box Office Company, a worldwide organisation dedicated to the cinema industry. During this time I helped develop a new booking platform that was rolled out to over 100 cinema chains across the globe. After identifying the need for an internal automation suite to cover all testing scenarios of the booking platform, I transitioned into the role of QA/Product Owner. For this role I was responsible for quality assurance as well as the overall design and vision of the internal testing suite and it's user interface. This required developing more advanced skills in product design, product management as well as manual and automated testing.

Eager to expand my knowledge of product design and UX further, I completed a Google UX Design Certificate and began a career working with Giki, a BCorp helping organisations across the globe to take climate action through the use of their website and mobile app. I currently hold the position of QA/Product Designer responsible for the full design process including [Wireframing](/2023/07/28/wireframing/), [Prototyping](/2023/09/28/prototyping/), developing the [UI Library](/2023/09/15/pattern-libraries/) as well as design QA, ensuring all design and functionalty is up to an AA level of accessibility conformance.
